- **Local Storage**: Persistent data storage across browser sessions

## üõ† Tech Stack and Rationale

### Core Technologies
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks for component state management and lifecycle
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and improved developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for optimal performance

### UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework chosen for rapid, consistent styling and robust mobile responsiveness
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful, customizable icons for consistent visual language

### State Management
- **Custom Hooks**: Clean separation of concerns with `useContacts` hook for data management
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching (configured but using localStorage for demo)

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing and optimization
- **Autoprefixer**: Cross-browser CSS compatibility

## üé® Design Choices and Assumptions

### Dark Mode Theme
The application uses a sophisticated dark theme as the primary design choice. This decision was made because:
- **Modern Appeal**: Dark themes are increasingly popular in professional applications
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Better for extended use, especially in low-light environments
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Aligns with modern SaaS and developer tool interfaces

### Card-Based Grid Layout
The default grid layout uses cards for several reasons:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Cards create clear boundaries and improve content organization
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Cards adapt naturally to different screen sizes
- **Information Density**: Allows users to see more contacts at once while maintaining readability
- **Interactive Elements**: Cards provide clear touch targets for mobile users

### Case-Insensitive Search Implementation
The search functionality converts both search terms and contact data to lowercase before comparison. This approach:
- **User-Friendly**: Matches user expectations for search behavior
- **Comprehensive**: Ensures no contacts are missed due to case differences
- **Performance**: Simple string operations with minimal overhead
- **Accessibility**: Reduces cognitive load for users

### Key Components
- **useContacts**: Custom hook managing contact data and operations
- **ContactCard**: Individual contact display component
- **ContactModal**: Form for adding/editing contacts
- **SearchBar**: Real-time search functionality
- **ViewModeToggle**: Switch between grid and list views

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with zero configuration

### Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure redirects for SPA routing

### GitHub Pages
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Push the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for the basic setup. The application uses localStorage for data persistence.

### Customization
- **Theme**: Modify colors in `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Components**: Customize UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Data**: Update seed data in `src/data/seedContacts.ts`

## üìù Assumptions and Design Decisions

### Data Persistence
- Uses localStorage for demo purposes (simulates API calls with 1.5s delay)
- In production, this would connect to a real API endpoint
- Contact IDs are generated using `crypto.randomUUID()`

### Form Validation
- Email validation using regex pattern
- Phone validation accepts various formats (US-focused)
- Required fields: name, email, phone, company

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px (single column)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (2 columns)
- Desktop: > 1024px (3-4 columns)

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast ratios
- Focus indicators
